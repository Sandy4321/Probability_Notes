##Stochastic Processes
A stochastic process is a special type of probability model in which the sample points represent func- tions in time.
- It often can be viewed as a sequence of random variables evolving in time. Often there is a continuum of random variables, one for each real valued instant of time.
- A discrete stochastic process is a stochastic process where either the random variables are discrete in time or the set of possible sample values is discrete.
